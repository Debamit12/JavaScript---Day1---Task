Objects and its internal representation in Javascript:

Objects, fundamental data structures in JavaScript, store collections of key-value pairs, allowing organization of
related information under a single entity. Unlike primitive data types (such as numbers, strings, booleans)
holding single values, objects store complex data and may reference other objects.

Keys in a key-value pair are called properties.
Properties can hold various data types, including strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, or even other objects.
Objects can also have methods, which are functions associated with the object.
These functions can operate on the object's data (properties) or perform specific .

While JavaScript's internal implementation details are subject to change across different browsers and JavaScript engines,
objects are generally believed to be represented using hash tables.
Hash tables are data structures that store key-value pairs with a fast lookup mechanism. When you define a property in an object,
the JavaScript engine calculates a unique hash code for the property key.
This hash code is then used to efficiently store and retrieve the corresponding value within the hash table.

For example:

const person = {
  firstName: "Alice",
  lastName: "Smith",
  age: 30,
  greet: function() {
    console.log("Hello, my name is " + this.firstName + " " + this.lastName);
  }
};

The person object has properties like firstName, lastName, and age. The greet property is a method (function) associated with the object.
Internally, the JavaScript engine likely uses a hash table to store these key-value pairs.
The hash code for each property key (e.g., "firstName") allows for quick retrieval of the corresponding value (e.g., "Alice").

Objects are dynamic in JavaScript. You can add or remove properties even after creating the object.
The order in which properties are defined doesn't necessarily reflect the order they are stored internally.
JavaScript doesn't have a built-in mechanism to directly access the underlying hash table or the internal representation of objects.
